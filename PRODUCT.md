# book-restaurant-scraping — Product brief

**Slug:** `bookchaowalit/book-restaurant-scraping`  
**Generated:** 2026-08-11 (bulk Book Dev closeout)  
**Status:** collection adapter present; scheduler still runs from `book-job-scraping`

## Purpose

Portfolio repository under Book Dev. This brief records ownership and the
current honest status so the nested tree is not an empty shell in the task
system.

## Runnable path

See `README.md` for install and run instructions when present.

## Current adapters

- `restaurants/wongnai_scraper.py`

Tests live under `tests/`. Runtime collection remains scheduled by
`book-job-scraping` until this repository has its own cron.

## Limits

- Not claimed as production-ready unless README and tests prove it.
- Mobile smoke / emulator acceptance is separate and toolchain-dependent.
